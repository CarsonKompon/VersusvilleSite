      <p><span class="headline">Who is the best Fashion Designer?</span><br />
        Spenny tries to bring political consciousness to the superficial world 
        of fashion, as Kenny finally gets his chance to create skimpy swimwear 
        and get close to yummy hottie models. </p>

      <p><span class="headline">Who can stay awake the longest?</span><br />
        The first one to fall asleep loses. Without stimulants Spenny feels he 
        can outlast the lazy Kenny but Kenny is chugging coffee because he&#8217;s 
        highly motivated by the prospect of eventual hallucinations.</p>

      <p><span class="headline">Who is the better chef?</span><br />
        Kenny has always been a much better cook than Spenny so he pledges to 
        play by the rules. Spenny, knowing he&#8217;s screwed, goes against his 
        moral code, and finally decides it&#8217;s time to cheat. </p>

      <p><span class="headline">Who can stand up the longest?</span><br />
        This competition degenerates into a philosophical argument about what 
        it means to stand. Is Kenny actually standing in his vertical sleeping 
        bag apparatus or has he just managed to outsmart Spenny?</p>

      <p><span class="headline">Who can sit on a cow the longest?</span><br />
        Dairy cows don&#8217;t like being mounted and they can run faster than 
        most people. Will Kenny&#8217;s bag of dirty tricks help him to stay on 
        his cow longer than Spenny? The boys risk life and limb and learn more 
        than they ever wanted to know about cow dung.</p>

      <p><span class="headline">Who is the sanest?</span><br />
        Kenny and Spenny get various psychiatric evaluations to see who is the 
        sanest. <br>
        Will Spenny&#8217;s paranoia and neurosis cost him victory, or will the 
        head-shrinkers see thorough Kenny&#8217;s con-man ways giving Spenny victory? 
      </p>

      <p><span class="headline">Who can earn the most money in three days?</span><br />
        Will Spenny&#8217;s hard work and perseverance win over Kenny&#8217;s 
        effortless and brilliant money making schemes? </p>

      <p><span class="headline">Who does she like better?</span><br />
        Kenny and Spenny agree to date the same girl -- the one she likes best 
        is the winner. Though they both try to impress, one has lost before the 
        competition has started. Kenny pulls out all the stops for this critically 
        important competition.</p>

      <p><span class="headline">Who can stay blindfolded the longest?</span><br />
        Kenny decides to make this competition &#8220;The Torture Spenny Show.&#8221; 
        Imagine being blind and having a madman torment you. Spenny won&#8217;t 
        have to imagine.</p>

      <p><span class="headline">Who can win a beauty pageant?</span><br />
        Formal wear, swimsuits, talent and personality will all be put to the 
        test as one of the boys gets to wear the tiara. Taking the superficial 
        route, Kenny makes himself as gorgeous as possible, while Spenny hopelessly 
        learns to tap dance. </p>

      <p><span class="headline">Who can win a series of mini-competitions?</span><br />
        Kenny and Spenny do a series of fast paced mini-competitions. Spitting 
        grapes, climbing stairs, standing on their head, rock/paper scissors, 
        wrestling &#8211; and many more. One gets injured, the other wins.</p>

      <p><span class="headline">Who can lose the most weight?</span><br />
        The boys risk heart attacks and fainting spells to see who can lose the 
        most weight in 72 hours. Laxatives, starvation, sweating, colonics, spitting 
        and dehydration are just a few strategies of this epic contest. Do not 
        try this at home!!!</p>

      <p><span class="headline">Who can stay handcuffed the longest?</span><br />
        The boys are handcuffed together and the first one to take off the cuffs 
        is the loser. Kenny becomes mega-annoying, cleverly using everything he 
        knows about Spenny to make his life a living hell.</p>
      <p><span class="headline">Who can put on the best concert?</span><br />
        The boys write and perform their own original song. Spenny embraces his 
        childhood fantasy and forms a rock band while Kenny tries to con the judges 
        by conducting a full children&#8217;s choir as they perform perhaps the 
        cheesiest song ever written. </p>
      <p><span class="headline">Who is the best parent?</span><br />
        It&#8217;s diapers, bottles and late night feeding as the boys get life-like, 
        state-of-the-art computer chip babies. The data is measured and whoever 
        has taken the best care of their baby is the winner.</p>
      <p><span class="headline">Who do kids like most?</span><br />
        Seven six year olds spend half the day with Kenny then half the day with 
        Spenny. The kids decide which guy they like most. Kenny spoils them rotten, 
        while Spenny takes them on a mysterious fantasy adventure.</p>
      <p><span class="headline">Who is the strongest?</span><br />
        Kenny, who knows he&#8217;s stronger, offers up his sister Miriam to compete 
        in a bench press competition. Spenny takes the challenge not fully realizing 
        that if he loses to Kenny&#8217;s sister, it will be the most humiliating 
        defeat he&#8217;s ever suffered.</p>
      <p><span class="headline">Who makes the most convincing woman?</span><br />
        The boys, in full drag, host a ladies-night-out cocktail party at the 
        house. The real women will choose which one has transformed himself into 
        the most convincing woman: Will it be Kendra, the slutty party girl, or 
        Spennita, the career woman, who wants it all.</p>
      <p><span class="headline">Who is the best actor?</span><br />
        Taking the stage, the boys perform a theater piece judged by a professional. 
        Kenny brings back the lost art of mime, while Spenny, using his embattled 
        friendship with Kenny as inspiration, writes and acts a scene where he 
        plays 1950&#8217;s down and out prize fighter. </p>
      <p><span class="headline">Who is the best male stripper?</span><br />
        The boys don g-strings and take to the poles to see who will make the 
        better male stripper. Kenny&#8217;s devious plot makes his own Tarzan 
        routine obsolete and puts Spenny&#8217;s stripping nerd character on the 
        brink. </p>
      <p><span class="headline">Who is the best figure skater?</span><br />
        The boys hit the rink to see who is the better figure skater. Kenny, as 
        usual, has to think on his feet because he can&#8217;t skate, while Spenny 
        works very hard on his ever-so-cheesy tribute to rock and roll. </p>
      <p><span class="headline">Who will use their arms first?</span><br>
        Kenny and Spenny are in another endurance contest. Their arms are tied 
        and <br>
        the first guy to use them loses. The boys have to try and survive, living 
        <br>
        life as amputees. Can they survive going to the bathroom, or eating and 
        <br>
        watching TV without the use of their most important appendages?<br>
      </p>
      <p><span class="headline">Who can survive in the woods the longest?</span><br />
        It&#8217;s a city boy&#8217;s worst nightmare, as Kenny and Spenny have 
        to fend for themselves in the unforgiving wilderness. This fish-out-of-water 
        competition has the boys pathetically attempting to make fire, hunt, forage, 
        build shelter while driving each other crazy.</p>
      <p><span class="headline">Kenny takes Spenny to court for money owed</span><br />
        Kenny thinks that Spenny owes him a lot of money from picking up tabs 
        over the years. He takes Spenny to court, brilliantly arguing his case 
        as Spenny attempts to assassinate Kenny&#8217;s character, which given 
        his behavior on the show, shouldn&#8217;t be too hard. </p>
      <p><span class="headline">Who can live in a van the longest?<br />
        </span>The boys see who can last the longest living in the same van. <br>
        Spenny, scared to death of Kenny's driving, opts for the front, while 
        <br>
        Kenny turns the back of the van into his own personal Turkish party <br>
        palace. This bizarre competition offers a unique, claustrophobic <br>
        twist on road rage.<br>
      </p>
      <p><span class="headline">Boxing</span><br />
        After a season of competing, the boys decide to punch out their mutual 
        frustration with each other in the squared-circle. Are best friends really 
        capable of beating the crap out of each other? Watch as tensions explode 
        in a most surprising and sadistic season finale.</p>
