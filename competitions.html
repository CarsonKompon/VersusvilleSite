                 <p><span class="headline">Who is the best Fashion Designer?</span><br>
                    Spenny tries to bring political consciousness to the superficial world 
                    of fashion, as Kenny finally gets his chance to create skimpy swimwear 
                    and get close to yummy hottie models. 
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Who can stay awake the longest?</span><br>
                    The first one to fall asleep loses. Without stimulants Spenny feels he 
                    can outlast the lazy Kenny but Kenny is chugging coffee because he’s 
                    highly motivated by the prospect of eventual hallucinations.
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Who is the better chef?</span><br>
                    Kenny has always been a much better cook than Spenny so he pledges to 
                    play by the rules. Spenny, knowing he’s screwed, goes against his 
                    moral code, and finally decides it’s time to cheat. 
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Who can stand up the longest?</span><br>
                    This competition degenerates into a philosophical argument about what 
                    it means to stand. Is Kenny actually standing in his vertical sleeping 
                    bag apparatus or has he just managed to outsmart Spenny?
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Who can sit on a cow the longest?</span><br>
                    Dairy cows don’t like being mounted and they can run faster than 
                    most people. Will Kenny’s bag of dirty tricks help him to stay on 
                    his cow longer than Spenny? The boys risk life and limb and learn more 
                    than they ever wanted to know about cow dung.
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Who is the sanest?</span><br>
                    Kenny and Spenny get various psychiatric evaluations to see who is the 
                    sanest. <br>
                    Will Spenny’s paranoia and neurosis cost him victory, or will the 
                    head-shrinkers see thorough Kenny’s con-man ways giving Spenny victory? 
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Who can earn the most money in three days?</span><br>
                    Will Spenny’s hard work and perseverance win over Kenny’s 
                    effortless and brilliant money making schemes? 
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Who does she like better?</span><br>
                    Kenny and Spenny agree to date the same girl -- the one she likes best 
                    is the winner. Though they both try to impress, one has lost before the 
                    competition has started. Kenny pulls out all the stops for this critically 
                    important competition.
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Who can stay blindfolded the longest?</span><br>
                    Kenny decides to make this competition “The Torture Spenny Show.” 
                    Imagine being blind and having a madman torment you. Spenny won’t 
                    have to imagine.
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Who can win a beauty pageant?</span><br>
                    Formal wear, swimsuits, talent and personality will all be put to the 
                    test as one of the boys gets to wear the tiara. Taking the superficial 
                    route, Kenny makes himself as gorgeous as possible, while Spenny hopelessly 
                    learns to tap dance. 
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Who can win a series of mini-competitions?</span><br>
                    Kenny and Spenny do a series of fast paced mini-competitions. Spitting 
                    grapes, climbing stairs, standing on their head, rock/paper scissors, 
                    wrestling &ndash; and many more. One gets injured, the other wins.
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Who can lose the most weight?</span><br>
                    The boys risk heart attacks and fainting spells to see who can lose the 
                    most weight in 72 hours. Laxatives, starvation, sweating, colonics, spitting 
                    and dehydration are just a few strategies of this epic contest. Do not 
                    try this at home!!!
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Who can stay handcuffed the longest?</span><br>
                    The boys are handcuffed together and the first one to take off the cuffs 
                    is the loser. Kenny becomes mega-annoying, cleverly using everything he 
                    knows about Spenny to make his life a living hell.
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Who can put on the best concert?</span><br>
                    The boys write and perform their own original song. Spenny embraces his 
                    childhood fantasy and forms a rock band while Kenny tries to con the judges 
                    by conducting a full children’s choir as they perform perhaps the 
                    cheesiest song ever written. 
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Who is the best parent?</span><br>
                    It’s diapers, bottles and late night feeding as the boys get life-like, 
                    state-of-the-art computer chip babies. The data is measured and whoever 
                    has taken the best care of their baby is the winner.
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Who do kids like most?</span><br>
                    Seven six year olds spend half the day with Kenny then half the day with 
                    Spenny. The kids decide which guy they like most. Kenny spoils them rotten, 
                    while Spenny takes them on a mysterious fantasy adventure.
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Who is the strongest?</span><br>
                    Kenny, who knows he’s stronger, offers up his sister Miriam to compete 
                    in a bench press competition. Spenny takes the challenge not fully realizing 
                    that if he loses to Kenny’s sister, it will be the most humiliating 
                    defeat he’s ever suffered.
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Who makes the most convincing woman?</span><br>
                    The boys, in full drag, host a ladies-night-out cocktail party at the 
                    house. The real women will choose which one has transformed himself into 
                    the most convincing woman: Will it be Kendra, the slutty party girl, or 
                    Spennita, the career woman, who wants it all.
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Who is the best actor?</span><br>
                    Taking the stage, the boys perform a theater piece judged by a professional. 
                    Kenny brings back the lost art of mime, while Spenny, using his embattled 
                    friendship with Kenny as inspiration, writes and acts a scene where he 
                    plays 1950’s down and out prize fighter. 
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Who is the best male stripper?</span><br>
                    The boys don g-strings and take to the poles to see who will make the 
                    better male stripper. Kenny’s devious plot makes his own Tarzan 
                    routine obsolete and puts Spenny’s stripping nerd character on the 
                    brink. 
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Who is the best figure skater?</span><br>
                    The boys hit the rink to see who is the better figure skater. Kenny, as 
                    usual, has to think on his feet because he can’t skate, while Spenny 
                    works very hard on his ever-so-cheesy tribute to rock and roll. 
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Who will use their arms first?</span><br>
                    Kenny and Spenny are in another endurance contest. Their arms are tied 
                    and <br>
                    the first guy to use them loses. The boys have to try and survive, living 
                    <br>
                    life as amputees. Can they survive going to the bathroom, or eating and 
                    <br>
                    watching TV without the use of their most important appendages?<br>
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Who can survive in the woods the longest?</span><br>
                    It’s a city boy’s worst nightmare, as Kenny and Spenny have 
                    to fend for themselves in the unforgiving wilderness. This fish-out-of-water 
                    competition has the boys pathetically attempting to make fire, hunt, forage, 
                    build shelter while driving each other crazy.
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Kenny takes Spenny to court for money owed</span><br>
                    Kenny thinks that Spenny owes him a lot of money from picking up tabs 
                    over the years. He takes Spenny to court, brilliantly arguing his case 
                    as Spenny attempts to assassinate Kenny’s character, which given 
                    his behavior on the show, shouldn’t be too hard. 
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Who can live in a van the longest?<br>
                    </span>The boys see who can last the longest living in the same van. <br>
                    Spenny, scared to death of Kenny's driving, opts for the front, while 
                    <br>
                    Kenny turns the back of the van into his own personal Turkish party <br>
                    palace. This bizarre competition offers a unique, claustrophobic <br>
                    twist on road rage.<br>
                 </p>
                 <p><span class="headline">Boxing</span><br>
                    After a season of competing, the boys decide to punch out their mutual 
                    frustration with each other in the squared-circle. Are best friends really 
                    capable of beating the crap out of each other? Watch as tensions explode 
                    in a most surprising and sadistic season finale.
