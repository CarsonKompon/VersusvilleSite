                    <p><span class="headline">Who can drink more beer?</span><br/>  
                        The guys compete to see who can drink more beer - and puking means disqualification! Since Spenny's a much more experienced boozer, he's sure he has this one in the bag.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="headline">Who can stay naked longest? </span><br/> 
                        When Kenny and Spenny see who can go longer without wearing any clothes, Spenny tries to overcome his shame of being
                        naked, while Kenny goes all-out in a bid to maximize his friend's embarrassment and discomfort.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="headline">Who has the biggest balls?</span><br/>  
                        When Kenny and Spenny go head-to-head in a series of mini-competitions to see who has the biggest balls, Kenny goes
                        beyond the usual crazy stunts, trying to psyche Spenny out, by trying to expose him as a whining bitch.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="headline">Who do old people like more?</span><br/>  
                        The boys each get to entertain a group of elderly ladies, who will then vote on whom they like better. Spenny tries to make the seniors feel loved and appreciated, while Kenny tugs on their heartstrings by conning them.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="headline">Who can dance the longest?</span><br/>  
                        The guys compete in a torturous endurance dance marathon. Kenny has a diabolical plan that will leave Spenny paranoid,confused and humiliated.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="headline">First one to talk loses?</span><br/>
                        The rules are simple: the first guy to say a word loses; grunting is
                        allowed. Spenny tries to take advantage of the fact that Kenny talks in his
                        sleep. Can Kenny abuse Spenny without talking?
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="headline">Who is funnier?</span><br/>
                        Spenny's strategy is to return to his stand-up comedy roots. Meanwhile,
                        Kenny, realizing the epic nature of the competition, decides to pull out all
                        the stops, and pulls off the meanest practical joke he has ever perpetrated
                        on Spenny.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="headline">Who can kiss more women?</span><br/>
                        Kenny uses deception in an attempt to slime as many kisses as humanly
                        possible. Spenny paranoid of catching herpes, uses a direct and honest
                        approach to get women to kiss him.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="headline">Who can win a rat race?</span><br/>
                        Kenny and Spenny go back to one of their oldest childhood competitions and
                        decide to race rodents. Will Kenny's rat-like tendencies help him win, or
                        will Spenny's disciplined coaching lead his rat to victory?
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="headline">Who is the better journalist?</span><br/>  
                        The boys compete to see who can break the
                        better news story. Spenny goes on a journey into his own personal heart of
                        darkness. Kenny, meanwhile, tries to generate some of his own news by
                        staging a tabloid media hoax.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="headline">Who can sell more bibles?</span><br/>
                        Kenny and Spenny square off to see who can sell more bibles. Kenny has a
                        brilliant plan to teach Spenny a moral biblical lesson that he will never
                        forget.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="headline">First one to be mean loses</span><br/>
                        In a total reversal of Kenny's
                        behavior, the guys compete to see who can go longer without being mean to
                        the other. Kenny attempts to overwhelm his best friend with a highly
                        suspicious onslaught of love and caring.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="headline">Who is the better rapper?</span><br/>  
                        Spenny, who doesn't know much about rap, uses the opportunity to put out an educational message through his music. Kenny uses Spenny's ignorance of rap music against him, rapping his way to the final
                        showdown.
