                    <p><span class="headline">First Guy to  Get a Boner Loses</span><br> 
                        Wearing tiny swimsuits to prevent boner hiding, Spenny is counting  on Kenny’s love of women and the element of surprise to win. Kenny's strategy  is to offer himself to his pal and get Spenny out of the closet once and for  all &ndash; but is Spenny really gay?
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="headline">Who Can Blow  the Biggest Fart?</span><br>
                        Armed with gas masks the crew is forced to record perhaps the  smelliest competition to date. Kenny, the fart-maestro, is shocked to find out  that Spenny's gas-inducing diet is making him competitive.&nbsp; So, Kenny must dig deep to into his bag of  tricks (and bowels) in order to win this methane-filled contest.
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="headline">Who Can Make  the Best Viral Video?</span><br>
                        The guys each make a series of videos and must choose one to put  online. The video that goes more viral wins. Kenny, the more Internet savvy of  the two, makes an eclectic series of shocking videos dealing with: 9/11,  terrorists, pranks, and celebrity spoofs. Spenny, who thinks viral videos are  generally idiotic, disregards his personal opinion and does everything in his  power to defeat Kenny including consuming excrement.
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="headline">Who Can Eat  More Meat?</span><br>
                        Hold on to your stomachs for an all-you-can-eat carnivorous bloat  fest: whichever guy eats more meat is the winner.&nbsp; Kenny, a pig by any definition, summons the  gluttonous gods and gorges like never before, while Spenny chooses the more  methodical approach of eating, exercising, resting and moving his bowels.
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="headline">First Guy to  Get a Stain Loses </span><br>
                        Wearing white body suits, the boys put themselves through numerous  high-risk stain situations in an effort to stay as stain-free as possible.&nbsp; After a few false starts, Kenny's character  is more stained then their suits.
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="headline">Who Can be Tied to a Goat the Longest?</span><br>
                        The boys are each tethered to a live goat. The first one to break  the bond loses. Kenny, who wants to have fun with his goat, cleverly uses an  extremely long rope in hopes that Spenny will be stuck taking care of both goats.  Spenny tries his best to toilet train his goat and keep him smelling as  pleasant as possible. Though it’s not easy, the goat is still a better roommate  than Kenny.
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="headline">Who Can  Handle More Torture?</span><br>
                        Whoever can take the most pain wins. Spenny, in order to get  motivated, dedicates his performance to his late father, while Kenny becomes  not only a competition participant but also the torturer.
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="headline">First Guy to  Stop Singing Loses </span><br>
                        The first one to stop singing loses in this surprisingly grueling  competition. Kenny explores various musical genres while creating a fictitious  and hideously slanderous version of Spenny's family tree. Spenny decides to get  motivated by singing for charity, trying to raise money to buy a piano for a  community center.
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="headline"> Who Can be  Obese the Longest? </span><br>
                        The boys put on 80-pound weights, the first one to take off the  weights is the loser. Kenny takes the opportunity to rip on fat people.&nbsp; Spenny has a tough time when his bad back  acts up but thinks he may have uncovered one of Kenny’s master plans.
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="headline">Who Can  Commit the Most Crime?</span><br>
                        Possessing a natural criminal mind, Kenny tries to break every law  in the book, while Spenny tries to commit politically correct crimes and  unleash his inner-criminal.
