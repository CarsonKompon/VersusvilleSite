                    <p><span class="headline">First To Laugh Loses</span><br>
                        Doing his best to make Spenny laugh, Kenny engages in an outrageous barrage of funny costumes and ridiculous characters. Thinking defensively, Spenny tries to plunge himself into a deep depression and existential crisis.
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="headline">Who Do Gay Guys Like More?</span><br>
                        Kenny and Spenny each go on a date with the same gay man, who will decide whom he likes better. Spenny decides that he will do anything to win, while Kenny does everything in his power to make Spenny look like a scumbag.
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="headline">Who Can Wear A Dead Octopus On Their Head The Longest?</span><br>
                        The boys see who can wear a dead octopus on his head in this brutal endurance competition. Both guys lose their minds as a rotting corpse stinks up their scalps…one more than the other.
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="headline">Who Can Win A Ten Mile Race?</span><br>
                        In this brutal endurance competition Kenny is at a disadvantage, Spenny is a runner, but that's not the reason why this competition turns out to be a disaster.
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="headline">Who Can Make A Better Porno?</span><br>
                        Judged by a professional porn producer, the guys compete to see who can make a better porno movie. Spenny decides to recreate an unfulfilled teenage fantasy, while Kenny decides to star in his own production, producing the first sketch comedy porno ever made.
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="headline">Who Can Lift More Weight With Their Genitals?</span><br>
                        Qigong is the ancient contest of genital weightlifting. Spenny and Kenny stretch their genitals to the extreme. But, unfortunately, both guys have more to worry about than hernias.
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="headline">Who is Cooler?</span><br>
                        The boys compete to see which one is “cooler.” In possibly his lamest strategy to date, Spenny tries to transforms himself with a Johnny Depp impersonation. Kenny, knowing he’s cooler, just relaxes and parties.
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="headline">Who Can Produce More Semen?</span><br>
                        The boys see who can produce the most semen in a week. Kenny, knowing that Spenny is a master of masturbation, must do something drastic to stop him!
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="headline">Who Can Stay in a Haunted House the Longest?</span><br>
                        The guys see who can best manipulate the supernatural. Spenny, who is afraid of ghosts, uses white witchcraft and his guardian angel to protect himself, while Kenny, who doesn't believe in ghosts, tries to frighten his best friend by scaring the living shit out of him. 
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="headline">Who Can Catch A Bigger Fish?</span><br>
                        The guys head out to sea in a fishing competition. Spenny claims to be the better fisherman, but Kenny wants Spenny to be the catch of the day.
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="headline">Who Can Imitate The Other Guy Better?</span><br>
                        Judged by the crew, the guys must impersonate each other for several days. Spenny's impersonation of Kenny is good, but when Kenny starts to portray Spenny in a horribly negative light, Spenny breaks character in order to defend himself.
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="headline">Who Can Stay Homeless The Longest?</span><br>
                        The boys decide to give up all the comforts of home and see who can stay homeless the longest. Will Spenny survive without his hand sanitizer and sunscreen, or will Kenny’s lack of coffee and videogames give Spenny the edge?
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="headline">Arm Wrestling Competition</span><br>
                        Kenny and Spenny decide to have an arm wrestling competition. Terrified that Kenny will tamper with him, Spenny hires a security force and a trainer, while Kenny unveils his most unpredictable plot to date.
