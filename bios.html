      Kenny's video Manifesto </span></a> <p>Kenny is the middle child of two 
        wonderful parents who did not deserve the aggravation. At three years 
        of age he inadvertently chopped off the top of his index finger in a bicycle. 
        He still swears that Spenny had something to do with it! At the age of 
        eight, while impersonating Evil Knievel at his older brother's birthday 
        party, Kenny jumped a ramp on his Big Wheel that left a scar on his chin. 
        Realizing it was safer, Kenny cleverly moved from abusing himself to abusing 

        Spenny.</p>
      <p>Like most pals, Kenny and Spenny have always competed against one another. 
        Kenny sees every contest as a way to have fun, get things for free, meet 
        girls and humiliate his pal on national television. He feels that he can 
        beat Spenny &quot;fair and square&quot; but admits that would take all 
        the fun out of it. Kenny loves to compete against Spenny, because Spenny 
        is an only child and isn't used to sibling rivalry. &quot;I'm like the 
        tormenting brother he never had and probably didn't want.&quot;</p>
      <p>Spenny thinks that Kenny sometimes cheats, but Kenny feels that he&#8217;s 
        actually intellectually outsmarting his neurotic pal. &quot;I'm not a 
        cheater. Every stunt I pull is legal -- most of the time.&quot; Kenny 
        enjoys taking the easy way out and watching Spenny bust his butt to win. 
        &quot;I use Spenny's tactics against him and let him destroy himself.&quot; 
        Kenny feels that Spenny deserves what he gets. &quot;Spenny knows me better 
        than anyone. He knows what he's up against. Don't feel sorry for him - 
        feel sorry for me for having to waste my time crushing him.&quot;<br>

      <p>Spencer &quot;Spenny&quot; Rice was born in Toronto. He&#8217;s a stress 
        case who sees life as an enormous struggle ending in a dark and empty 
        nothingness. With great difficulty he has tried to find a reason for his 
        existence. He has spent his life in conflict with himself, always trying 
        to be the best person he can, under horrific circumstances. Unlike Kenny, 
        he believes that only through suffering can he achieve fleeting moments 
        of joy and happiness. Unbelievably, he manages to get out of bed almost 
        every morning.</p>
      <p>He started competing at a young age with his ever-devious best friend, 
        Kenny. The two competed over everything and it became an obsession for 
        Spenny to beat Kenny without compromising his principles. &quot;He thinks 
        that winning is all that matters and I don't,&quot; says Spenny, who now 
        sees their silly competitions as nothing less than a biblical struggle 
        between good and evil. Occasionally, when he has been losing, Spenny has 
        tried to &quot;bend&quot; the rules, but found himself overwhelmed by 
        feelings of guilt and shame. Nonetheless, in the face of almost certain 
        defeat he heroically, perhaps masochistically, or most likely pathetically, 
        continues to engage Kenny in competition after competition.<br>
        So why does he do it? Why compete? Why be humiliated? The answer is simple: 
        Spenny wants to prove that the good guy can win by playing fair. That 
        may sound lame, and it probably is, but that's what motivates him. &quot;Winning 
        once by playing fair is more satisfying than winning a thousand times 
        by cheating.&quot; Spenny says as he puts on a diaper and a baby bonnet 
        for one of the many humiliations he endures at the sadistic hands of Kenny. 
        Though the odds are generally stacked against Spenny, one has to admire 
        his tenacity, righteousness, ethics and moral foundation - or not.</p>
