# Kenny VS Spenny Versusville Website

This is a re-creation of the official [Kenny VS Spenny Website](http://kennyvsspenny.tv) as it was in ~2005 when Versusville was available for download. [The site is currently the official unofficial host of Versusville downloads.](https://versusville.com/game.html)

The site is based on files received from [Library and Archives Canada](https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/CollectionSearch/Pages/record.aspx?app=fonandcol&IdNumber=213860&new=-8585729946741984986) and snapshots from WayBackMachine. It contains up-to-date content from kennyvsspenny.tv, as well as since-deleted content from cbc.ca/kennyvsspenny.

The `master` branch is the version that is live on versusville.com.

The `original` branch contains the files received from [Library and Archives Canada](https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/CollectionSearch/Pages/record.aspx?app=fonandcol&IdNumber=213860&new=-8585729946741984986) as they were.
